Here are some examples of data visualisations for climate hazards. These maps were made using code I wrote in `R` and open-source data (references below).

### Flood hazard map 

Data comes from the Aqueduct Floods research programme, carried out by the World Resources Institute & consortium. Below we see the extent of flood that will have a 1/10 chance of occurring in any given year in India and Pakistan - around the 2050 horizon and according to a RCP 8.5 scenario.

### 1. Title of map #1

The TRI for region Île-de-France (Territoires à Risque d'Inondation) - scenario 1.4, dubbed "extreme" - is shown in a geobrowser. Darker colors depict higher levels of water. The TRI was developed by DRIEE and the Préfecture IDF in 2013.

### Web app

This snapshot is of a web application I coded using data made available by the French administration. A dashboard in another tab computes statistics on the hazard exposure of assets.
