What you will find here are a few examples of physical climate risk maps.

##### They display several hazards at different points across space, time, climate scenarios, climate models and probability distributions. These maps were made for research purposes using open-source data (references below) and code I wrote in `R`.

### Flood hazard maps - Aqueduct

These two maps show the extent of flood that will have a 1/10 chance of occurring in any given year (10-year return period, 10% AEP) around the 2050 horizon, according to climate simulations run using scenario RCP 8.5.

###### Data for this map comes from the [Aqueduct Floods](https://www.wri.org/aqueduct/floods) research programme, conducted by the World Resources Institute (WRI) & a consortium of partners. Relevant documentation is [here](https://www.wri.org/research/aqueduct-floods-methodology).

###### Flood risk linked to subsidence was included. The multi-model mean - using projections from all 5 General Circulation Models (GCMs) - was calculated for riverine flood. The 95th percentile was selected for coastal flood. Version #2 of Aqueduct Floods - released 10/2020 - was used.


### High-resolution flood modelling over the Seine river basin

What you see below is the extent of flood under scenario 1.4, dubbed "extreme", as seen in a geobrowser. Darker colors depict higher levels of flood.

##### The [TRI map](http://www.driee.ile-de-france.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/tri-de-la-metropole-francilienne-a1769.html) for the Paris region (Territoires à risque important d’inondation, métropole francilienne) was built by the Préfecture d'Île-de-France and DRIEAT with support from French research laboratories. Documentation is available [here](http://webissimo.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/20170209_atlas_idf_a3_paysage_document_principal_cle5be11d.pdf).



### Web application: an interactive hazard map showing critical infrastructure

This is a snapshot of a web application I developed using open source data on climate hazards, biodiversity and energy & industry infrastructure. A dashboard in another tab computes statistics on the exposure of infrastructure to the climate hazard selected by the user.

##### Just before this snapshot was taken, a bunch of layers for the South-Eastern region of France were selected.

##### Data for this web app comes from various plaforms managed by services of the French administration ([DataSud](https://www.datasud.fr/), [GeoIDE](http://carto.geo-ide.application.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/1131/environnement.map), [GeoRisques](https://www.georisques.gouv.fr/donnees/bases-de-donnees)) and from the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) World Database on Protected Areas [(WDPA)](https://www.iucn.org/theme/protected-areas/our-work/quality-and-effectiveness/world-database-protected-areas-wdpa). 
Base layers are from OpenStreetMap and Stamen.
